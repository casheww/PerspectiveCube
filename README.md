# PerspectiveCube
*A cube with some funky tricks.*

This was my first time using Unity, so don't expect anything too fancy. It's pretty buggy and very flawed, but man... I just wanted to play around with some cubes.

Essentially, while "holding" the cube the user can scroll up/down to manipulate it. While it may not appear to do anything at first, 
the cube is in fact shrinking and growing, but also moving closer and further away, so the apparent size remains constant.

Controls
- WASD movement with mouse for camera rotation
- left shift to "hold" the cube
- scroll wheel (only while left shift is held)
  - scroll down : cube becomes smaller and closer
  - scroll up : cube becomes larger and further away
